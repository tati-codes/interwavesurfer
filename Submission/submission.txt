Description/details (typos intentional):
ðŸš€ This is a fan remake of the old shareware game (i think it used to be dreamcast). Like a life sim MMO. Kinda Dark Souls meets Animal Crossing? It's hard to say tbh, I spent a lot of the time just decorating my house... XD

BUT come see what I built! Found and old CD and did my best to decomple it

If you have bug reports, notes, memories of the game or any concrete info (plz I_I) then Id love some of your input in the ongong thread:

id love to make the whole game. I know it's a big undetakin but it was one of my favourites as a kid and I never got to meet fran but she sounds SO cool. If you have any info on Fran I've gotta hear it <.<
